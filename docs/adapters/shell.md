The shell adapter is an adapter that provides a simple REPL for interacting
with a hubot locally. It is useful for testing scripts before deploying them.

## Getting Started

To use the shell adapter you can simply omit the `-a` option when running
hubot

    % bin/hubot

## Configuring the Adapter

The shell adapter doesn't require any configuration.
