# Hubot Adapters

Adapters are the interface to the service you want your hubot to run on.

## Writing Your Own adapter

The best place to start is `src/adapter.coffee`, and inheriting from `Adapter`.
There is not as much documentation as could exist, so it is worth reviewing
existing adapters as well as how hubot internally uses an adpater.
