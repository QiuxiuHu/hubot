# Hubot

This is a version of GitHub's Campfire bot, hubot. He's pretty cool.

**You'll probably never have to hack on this repo directly.**

Instead this repo provides a library that's distributed by `npm` that you
simply require in your project. Follow the instructions below and get your own
hubot ready to deploy.
