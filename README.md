# Hubot

Hubot is a chat bot, modelled after GitHub's Campfire bot, hubot. He's pretty cool. He's extendable with [community scripts](https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts) and your own custom scripts, and can work on [many different chat services](docs/adapters.md).

**You'll probably never have to hack on this repo directly.**

Instead this repo provides a library that's distributed by `npm` that you
simply require in your project.  See the [documentation](docs/README.md) for more details on getting up an running with your very own robot friend.
